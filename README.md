# [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 2018! In HASKELL! 

Sooo.. Third year in a row! 🤓

## Haskell!
Second year with Haskell, hopefully giving more functional-like answers than [last year's code](https://github.com/GiovanniFrigo/advent-of-code-2017), which most of the time was using a functional syntax in a imperative way of thinking. 

## IDE

No IDE this year! Only Sublime Text, `ghci` and lots of lookups on [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/).

## Running the code

To run the code for a specific day, load it up in `ghci`, then call the `part1` or `part2` function:
```bash
$ ghci day42
GHCi, version 8.4.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
*Main> part1
42
*Main> part2
"42 is the answer"
```

The code could also be compiled with ghc for improved run-time performance:
```bash
$ ghc day42
$ ./day42
Solving..
Part 1: 42
Part 2: "42 is the answer"
```

## Journal

Just like the past years, I will keep a journal of the most challenging/interesting things I'll learn during this journey.
